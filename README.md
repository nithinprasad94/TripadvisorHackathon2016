# TripadvisorHackathon2016

# This was a 4 hour Hackathon conducted by Tripadvisor in Fall 2016. It required constructing a program to simulate a situation and 
# and optimize results. Unfortunately the problem statement itself was removed after the competition, and thus only the program remains. 

# Feel free to look at the program for my coding structure/style. It hasn't been modified since the competition, and thus all code was done
# and tested in the 4 hour time-frame, and only the 'working code' was submitted (as in I created improved solutions iteratively; however these
# solutions didn't compile in time, and thus their calls were commented out in main, and only the working solution was left up and running).
